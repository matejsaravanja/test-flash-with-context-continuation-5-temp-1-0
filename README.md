## About

**User requests:**
I want you to build me an app for buying premium NFTs. I want user to pay me 100 CRAFT (of course, user has to sign transaction). That transaction and user ownership of certain NFT should be stored somewhere. CRAFT is a Solana-based token btw. Once paid, user has to get access to that NFT in form of web, mail and image. For NFTs, generate some nice svg images.

## Project Plan
```
Okay, here's a simple project plan for building the premium NFT purchase application, based on the requirements you've provided. This plan focuses on the major tasks, dependencies, and key technical considerations.

**Project Name:** Premium NFT Purchase Application

**Goal:** Develop a web application that allows users to purchase premium NFTs using CRAFT tokens, with delivery in web, email, and image formats.

**Phases:**

1.  **Project Setup & Infrastructure (Estimated Time: 1 Week)**
2.  **Backend Development (Estimated Time: 3 Weeks)**
3.  **Frontend Development (Estimated Time: 3 Weeks)**
4.  **Integration & Testing (Estimated Time: 1 Week)**
5.  **Deployment (Estimated Time: 1 Week)**

**Phase 1: Project Setup & Infrastructure (1 Week)**

*   **Tasks:**
    *   Set up project repositories (Frontend & Backend).
    *   Configure development environments (local and staging).
    *   Choose and set up a database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB).
    *   Set up basic CI/CD pipeline (e.g., using GitHub Actions or GitLab CI).
    *   Define API specifications (using OpenAPI/Swagger).
*   **Technical Considerations:**
    *   **Database Choice:** Consider factors like scalability, schema flexibility, and ease of use. PostgreSQL might be a good choice for structured data (like transaction history and user-NFT mappings) if relational data integrity is a primary concern. MongoDB or similar noSQL databases can also be chosen, especially if the structure of recorded transactions is flexible and may change.
    *   **Environment Management:** Use tools like Docker and Docker Compose for consistent environment setup.
    *   **Version control:** Ensure strict version control for both the frontend and backend.
    *   **API Design:** Design a clear and RESTful API to facilitate communication.
    *   **Security best practices:** Implement early.

**Phase 2: Backend Development (3 Weeks)**

*   **Tasks:**
    *   Implement API endpoints for:
        *   Checking user CRAFT token balance (Solana interaction).
        *   Initiating NFT purchase (Solana transaction).
        *   Storing transaction history.
        *   Managing NFT ownership.
        *   Fetching NFT details
    *   Develop NFT generation logic (SVG creation).
    *   Implement email sending functionality (using a library or service like SendGrid/Mailgun).
    *   Implement the logic that will return the NFT data in different formats
*   **Technical Considerations:**
    *   **Solana Integration:** Use a Solana Python SDK (e.g., `solana`) to interact with the Solana blockchain. Handle transaction signing securely (consider using a hardware wallet or secure key management practices).
    *   **CRAFT Token Interaction:** Carefully handle the CRAFT token transfer, ensuring accuracy and security. Consider using a dedicated token program SDK.
    *   **NFT Generation:** Optimize SVG generation for performance and uniqueness. Implement error handling and logging.
    *   **Asynchronous Tasks:** Use task queues (e.g., Celery, RQ) for handling asynchronous tasks like email sending and potentially NFT generation if it's computationally intensive.
    *   **Error Handling & Logging:** Implement robust error handling and logging to facilitate debugging and monitoring.

**Phase 3: Frontend Development (3 Weeks)**

*   **Tasks:**
    *   Create React components for:
        *   User registration and login.
        *   Displaying CRAFT token balance.
        *   Initiating NFT purchase.
        *   Displaying transaction history.
        *   Displaying owned NFTs.
    *   Implement UI for interacting with the backend API.
    *   Implement NFT preview/display.
*   **Technical Considerations:**
    *   **UI Framework:** Use a component library (e.g., Material UI, Ant Design) for consistent UI elements.
    *   **State Management:** Choose a state management solution (e.g., Redux, Context API) for managing application state.
    *   **Solana Wallet Integration:** Integrate a Solana wallet adapter (e.g., Phantom) for secure transaction signing.
    *   **Responsiveness:** Ensure the UI is responsive and works well on different devices.
    *   **Accessibility:** Consider accessibility guidelines during development.

**Phase 4: Integration & Testing (1 Week)**

*   **Tasks:**
    *   Integrate the frontend and backend.
    *   Write and run unit tests for backend and frontend components.
    *   Conduct end-to-end testing.
    *   Perform security testing.
    *   Conduct user acceptance testing (UAT).
*   **Technical Considerations:**
    *   **Testing Frameworks:** Use appropriate testing frameworks (e.g., Jest, Mocha for frontend; pytest for backend).
    *   **Security Audits:** Conduct security audits utilizing tools and experts to identify vulnerabilities.
    *   **Cross-Browser Compatibility:** Test the application on different browsers and operating systems.
    *   **Performance Testing:** Ensure the application performs well under load.

**Phase 5: Deployment (1 Week)**

*   **Tasks:**
    *   Deploy the backend to a cloud platform (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud, Azure).
    *   Deploy the frontend to a CDN or hosting service (e.g., Netlify, Vercel).
    *   Configure DNS and SSL certificates.
    *   Set up monitoring and alerting.
*   **Technical Considerations:**
    *   **Scalability:** Choose a deployment environment that can scale as demand increases.
    *   **Security:**  Implement security best practices during deployment (e.g., using strong passwords, firewalls, and intrusion detection systems).
    *   **Monitoring:** Use monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana) to track application performance and identify issues.
    *   **Rollback Strategy:** Have a plan for rolling back deployments in case of errors.

**Key Project Considerations:**

*   **Security:** Security should be a top priority throughout the entire development lifecycle.  This includes secure coding practices, secure key management, and regular security audits.
*   **Scalability:**  The application should be designed to scale to handle a growing number of users and transactions.
*   **Performance:**  Optimize the application for performance to ensure a smooth user experience.
*   **User Experience:**  The user interface should be intuitive and easy to use.

**Communication:**

*   Regular project meetings to track progress and discuss challenges.
*   Use a communication platform (e.g., Slack, Discord) for quick updates and questions.

**Roles and Responsibilities:** (Will needs to be explicitly assigned).

*   Project Manager: Who is handling overall project management
*   Backend Developer(s): Responsible for backend development.
*   Frontend Developer(s): Responsible for frontend development.
*   QA Engineer(s): Responsible for testing.
*   DevOps Engineer(s): Responsible for deployment and infrastructure.

This plan provides a high-level overview.  Each phase will need further breakdown into smaller, more manageable tasks as the project progresses. Remember to iterate and adapt the plan as needed based on feedback and new information. Good luck!
